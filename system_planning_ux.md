# Task 3: System Planning and User Focus

## Question 1: What does it mean to install a program on your computer?

Program installation means a process of physically connecting software to hardware to make it ready to work.

## Question 2: Describe the differences and similarities between the installation process for software that you found in your research. ðŸ¤“Remember to add the citation for your sources.

When installing each software, some are open in source and some are not. For example, Linux is an open-source operating system, but windows and OS are not. If an operating system is not open in source, that means it is not compatible with software initially designed to function on another operating system, so applications and software for windows are not applicable on mac OS. Also, there are some more detailed differences in such as the rules in the naming of files. In windows, users can install software from either CD-Rom or a website and save it on the local disk. In Linux, the most common way is to install software from its distributionâ€™s repositories. In mac OS, you just have to double click on the file on a website and store it on the disk or SSD.

## Question 3: Consider your digital counting system and the different types of system installation presented in the textbook. Justify the choice of one installation system for your digital counter. 

Phased conversion should be the method of system installation for our groupâ€™s digital counting system because this type of conversion system does not require so much storage. Also, our counting system program is not going to be so complex, so there is no need to adopt the pilot method.

## Question 4: What strategies could you use to provide user documentation for your digital counting system?

Since the counting system will be multi-sensorial, expecting some potential disabled users, we can offer a voiceover guidance service as well as an online written manual. Also, it would be better to provide FAQs in a corner of our digital manual as we cannot afford Email support, online live chat services, remote desktop connections, or any kind of live guidance services.

## Question 5: Think about ways to improve the usability, usefulness, and desirability of your digital counter. Describe how your counter system addresses these three fundamental parts of the UX.

My groupâ€™s counting system does count 1-9 forward and backward in multi-sensorial ways, which fulfills the requirement in terms of usefulness. As for usability, our counting system is going to be easy to access for the potential users and counts at the best speed for the user in various types of notation. Desirability is the hardest task to complete for this project because differentiation from the competitors will be difficult. The little room to manage differentiation should be the design.
