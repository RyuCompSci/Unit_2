### Create a program that shows the definition of the terms usability, usefulness and desirability based on the userâ€™s input.

```.py
def UX_terms(input):
    out =""
    if input == "usability":
        out = "Usability is the degree to which something is able or fit to be used."
    elif input == "usefulness":
        out = "Usefulness is the fact of being useful or possible to use"
    elif input == "desirability":
        out = "Desirability is the quality or degree of having pleasing qualities or properties"
    return out
```
