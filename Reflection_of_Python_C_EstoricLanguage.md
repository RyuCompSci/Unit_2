### Reflection

Python was the first computer language that I learned and so at first it felt so complicated and irritating to utilize it. Learning multiple types of computer languages helped me understand more about the structure of programming language and how those have evolved over time. From binary to Python, I learned there are a wide range of user-friendliness of the language and also each or them has pros and cons. It showed that all computer systems consists of a combination of 0s and 1s, so revealed the difference of process comprehending an instruction. I comtemplate that We, humans, captures an idea based more on images or association, whereas computers functions by a bunch of simple instructions by CPU. Now some of those computer languages are in a different phase that the use or the idea of language came to be the main purpose of itself. Basically esoteric languages are designed as a joke or piece of art. For example, the one I searched up in the class was called "chef". In chef, we code something in a way like we write a note of recipe. On the first semester of G11, I learned some basic programming languages and its difference, features and aims.
